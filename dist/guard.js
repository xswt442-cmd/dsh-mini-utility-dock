// Host-side request guard shared by the DSH plugins.
//
// This fragment has ONE source of truth: dsh-mini-utility-dock/dist/guard.js.
// DSH plugin host halves are plain Node ESM that each package ships standalone,
// so the fragment is embedded into `lib/shared.js` at build time by
//   npm run guard:sync    (write it)
//   npm run guard:check   (fail on drift)
// instead of being imported: a bare `import 'dsh-mini-utility-dock/...'` would
// put a runtime dependency on the dock into every plugin, and the whole point of
// the dock is that a plugin works with no sibling installed.
//
// Why the guard is shared rather than reimplemented per plugin: the three
// plugins each carried their own `createGuard`, and the copies diverged. The
// parts that differed were never the *decisions* — they were the error codes and
// the message strings welded into the same function, which forced every repo to
// keep its own copy and made drift possible. Here the enforcement order and
// every decision are fixed, and the wording is supplied as data by the caller
// (`policy.messages`, `policy.allowRemoteHost`), so a plugin customizes text
// without forking the logic.
//
// The rejection order is deliberate and MUST NOT be reordered:
//   1. Fetch Metadata (`sec-fetch-site`)
//   2. TCP peer address + Host off-loopback  -> remote
//   3. Origin
//   4. Host allowlist
// It can be reordered for no reason: each step is an independent gate, and the
// tests drive each one with the others satisfied.
//
// Loopback semantics this guard relies on (see the loopback predicates):
//   * an ABSENT Host header counts as loopback — host-side callers using plain
//     node:http carry no Host;
//   * a Host header that is PRESENT but parses to no hostname does NOT count as
//     loopback — an unbracketed IPv6 literal is invalid per RFC 7230 and must
//     fail closed rather than skip the allowlist.

// Hostnames a request to a loopback-bound API may legitimately arrive with.
// Exact spellings only: `api.localhost` and `127.0.0.1.evil.example` must stay
// rejected, which is what keeps DNS rebinding out of the API surface.

/**
 * Build the same-origin request guard for a loopback-bound API route.

 * Not exported from the embedded block: each plugin publishes its own guard
 * bound to its own error vocabulary, so the name it exports — usually
 * `createGuard`, matching its previous API — is its own to declare. This is the
 * one factory every plugin calls.
 *
 * Enforces, in order: Fetch Metadata, the Host allowlist, then the TCP peer
 * address, then the Origin. Rejects by calling
 * `respond(res, 403, { ok: false, code, error })` and returning false; returns
 * true when the request may proceed.
 *
 * @param currentPort - the port this server listens on. A function is called per
 *   request so an Origin check follows a server whose port changes; a plain
 *   value is accepted for a fixed server.
 * @param respond - rejection sink, normally the plugin's `sendJson`. Kept
 *   injectable so tests can capture the rejection code instead of standing up a
 *   real ServerResponse.
 * @param allowRemoteHost - optional predicate. When it returns true, an
 *   off-loopback peer AND an off-loopback Host are admitted, because the caller
 *   has opted into verifying its own credential per request; the guard
 *   deliberately knows nothing about tokens. The Origin check still applies, so
 *   the exemption never widens the browser-facing boundary. A plugin that omits
 *   the predicate keeps absolute peer and Host criteria.
 * @param policy - optional per-reason `{ code, error }` overrides, keyed by
 *   `GUARD_REASONS`. A partial override merges with the default, so a plugin
 *   names only the reasons whose vocabulary differs. An unknown key throws: a
 *   typo would otherwise silently leave the default in place, and the plugin
 *   would expose a code no test expects.
